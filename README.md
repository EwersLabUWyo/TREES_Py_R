# TREES_Py_R

This repository has been created to store files for work in progress (WIP) to translate the Terrestrial Regional Ecosystem Exchange Simulatory (TREES) model from C++ to Python and R. The work will involve modularizing TREES into major components, improving code organization, and providing necessary annotation to increase accessibility to the broader ecohydrological and scientific community.

Updates will be posted here:

6/15/16 - Initial bark beetle impact module has been uploaded to the repository.
